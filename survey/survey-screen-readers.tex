\chapter{Screen Readers}

\label{chap:Intro}



Screen readers are software applications, primarily used by visually impaired people. Screen readers convert web content (text, buttons, images, and other elements) into speech or braille output. Screen readers attempt to convey what visually non-impaired people see on a display via non-visual means like text-to-speech, sound icons, or a braille device.

In May - June 2021, WebAIM surveyed the  preferences of screen reader users. They received 1568 valid responses. Figure~\ref{fig:screen-readers-piechart} shows the primary screen readers preferences. The majority of users use JAWS and NVDA screen readers as their primary screen readesr. Figure~\ref{fig:screen-readers-line} shows historical trends for primary screen reader usage. After a decade of decreases in primary usage, JAWS is once again the most used screen reader, with NVDA and VoiceOver both decreasing in primary usage over the last two years.

In this paper, we focus on JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, Narrator, and TalkBack screen readers. They are further described in the sections below.
