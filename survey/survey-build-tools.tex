\label{chap:Intro}

Accessibility can also be audited using tools that are integrated in the build
process.
Many of the browser extensions and web tools surveyed in this paper also offer
versions of the tools that can be used in the build process.
One benefit with these tools is that they offer instant feedback during development
without even opening the website, reducing the amount of work required for accessibility
auditing.
However, build tools for accessibility audits were not considered in this survey.
