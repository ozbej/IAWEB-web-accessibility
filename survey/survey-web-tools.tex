\chapter{Web Tools For Accessibility Audits}

\label{chap:WebTools}



Web tools for accessibility audits provide core auditing functionality to anyone interested. The amount of tools in this category is large, where most of these tools come to the same conclusions for an audited web page regardless to the level of detail. This is due to several factors, one being that many of these web tools are using the same core library to assess the accessibility of a given web site. In the case of web accessibility, this library is called axe-core which is provided by the Deque company.

In this survey the tools that are inspected closely are but a fraction of the tools that are currently available on the web. The chosen tools were selected in a way, which enables a closer look at tools that run with the axe core library and without. Additionally the selection also tries to show the different qualities of each choice and what can be expected when someone tries to use these tools online.

In this survey our selection of web tools for accessibility audits consists of the following: Accessi, WAVE and Page Speed Insights which is the web tool equivalent to the Lighthouse browser extension. All of the mentioned web tools will be discussed in further detail in the following sections. For each of these three tools there were also videos created, which demonstrates the features and the functionality of each of the tools. The videos also give a quick overview of the metrics that were used to determine the accessibility of the tested web sites.

\section{Showcase videos}
In this survey two web sites were targeted for evaluation by the aforementioned tools. For a good expamle concerning web accessibility the \url{https://www.gov.uk/} web site was chosen where as for the negative example \url{https://www.mirror.co.uk/} was the choice. The videos that were produced each showcase the interaction between the user, the tools and the web site that is being evaluated respectively. A video of this format was produced for Accessi \parencite{Accessi_vid}, WAVE \parencite{WAVE_vid} and Page Speed Insights (Lighthouse) \parencite{PageSpeedInsights_vid}. All of these videos showcase the features of the tool that is being covered as well ass highlighting a few extras the tool of each video might have over other tools that might have a different focus. The outcome of all of the videos is yet the same, as they all evaluate the positive example as being very well rated and rating the negative example as being non-compliant with the usual standards of accessibiliy for web sites.
